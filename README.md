# CNN Image Classification with PyTorch

**Geometric Shapes Classification (Circle, Square, Triangle)**

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a **complete Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) image classification pipeline using PyTorch**, trained on a **standard geometric shapes dataset** and tested on **real-world images captured using a smartphone**.

The goal of this assignment is to bridge **standard dataset training** with **real-world inference**, while ensuring **full automation, reproducibility, and correct deep learning practices**.

## 📂 Dataset Selection

**Chosen Dataset Option:**
**Geometric Shapes**

* **Training Classes:**

  * Circle
  * Square
  * Triangle

* **Standard Dataset:**
  A geometric shapes dataset (drawn/digital shapes)

* **Custom Dataset (Phone Task):**

  * 10 images drawn by hand on paper
  * Shapes photographed using a smartphone
  * Plain background to minimize noise
  * Images resized and processed to match training data format

### Folder Description

* **dataset/** → Contains the 10 custom smartphone images
* **model/** → Saved trained model state dictionary (`.pth`)
* **190110.ipynb** → Google Colab notebook (fully automated)
* **README.md** → Project documentation and results

## ⚙️ Data Preprocessing

All images undergo the **same preprocessing pipeline** to ensure consistency between training and real-world testing.

### Transform Pipeline

* Resize to fixed input size
* Convert to Tensor
* Normalize using dataset mean and standard deviation

```python
transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize((64, 64)),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.5], std=[0.5])
])
```

✔ Custom phone images are converted to the **same format, size, and normalization** as the training dataset.

## 🧠 CNN Model Architecture

The CNN is implemented from scratch using PyTorch and inherits from `nn.Module`.

### Architecture Summary

* **Convolutional Layers:**

  * Feature extraction using `nn.Conv2d`
* **Activation:**

  * `ReLU`
* **Pooling:**

  * `MaxPool2d`
* **Fully Connected Layers:**

  * Classification into 3 classes

```python
class CNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(CNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 32, 3)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(32, 64, 3)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(64 * 14 * 14, 128)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 3)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv2(x)))
        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x
```

## 🏋️ Training Details

* **Loss Function:** `CrossEntropyLoss`
* **Optimizer:** `Adam`
* **Batch Size:** 64
* **Epochs:** 10

### Training Loop

* Forward pass
* Loss computation
* Backpropagation
* Weight updates
* Accuracy tracking per epoch

The trained model is saved using:

```python
torch.save(model.state_dict(), "190110.pth")
```

---

## 📈 Training Results

### Loss vs Epochs

* Rapid decrease in training loss
* Loss converges close to **0.0**, indicating strong learning

### Accuracy vs Epochs

* Training accuracy increases from ~75% to **~100%**
* Stable convergence after a few epochs

✔ No signs of instability during training

---

## 🔍 Confusion Matrix (Standard Test Set)

A confusion matrix was generated on the **standard test dataset**.

**Observations:**

* Near-perfect classification across all classes
* Only **2 misclassifications** observed
* Strong generalization across shapes

---

## 📷 Real-World Testing (Custom Images)

The trained model was tested on **10 custom smartphone images**.

### Prediction Gallery Output

Each image displays:

```
Predicted Class (Confidence %)
```

**Examples:**

* Triangle (100.0%)
* Circle (99.9%)
* Square (97.9%)

✔ Model successfully classifies real-world images with **very high confidence**

---

## ❌ Visual Error Analysis

* 3 incorrectly classified samples from the test set are displayed
* Each shows:

  * True label
  * Predicted label

This analysis helps understand edge cases and confirms overall robustness.

## 🚀 Automation & Reproducibility

The notebook is **fully automated** and follows assignment constraints:

✔ Uses `git clone` to download custom images
✔ Automatically loads standard dataset via `torchvision`
✔ No manual file uploads required
✔ Can be run using **“Run All”** without path issues
